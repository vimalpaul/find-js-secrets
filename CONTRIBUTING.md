# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! To keep the project healthy:

- Fork the repo, create a feature branch, and open a pull request.
- Write clear commit messages and explain the reason for changes in PR description.
- Keep sensitive real-world data out of commits (use fake/example values).
- For major changes, open an issue first to discuss the design.

Happy hacking — and thank you!
